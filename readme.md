# Algebra: Linear Regression and Gradient Descent project

## About this project

This project explores linear regression using both the least squares method and gradient descent. 
It implements the matrix form of linear regression and applies it to a real-world dataset. 


The notebook covers data loading, exploration, and preprocessing before implementing linear regression models. 
It also compares the effectiveness of least squares and gradient descent approaches, discussing their advantages and limitations.


## Requirements:
